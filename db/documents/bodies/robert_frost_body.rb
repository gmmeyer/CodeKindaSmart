def road_not_taken_body
	<<-HTML

		Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
		And sorry I could not travel both
		And be one traveler, long I stood
		And looked down one as far as I could
		To where it bent in the undergrowth;

		Then took the other, as just as fair,
		And having perhaps the better claim,
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
		Though as for that the passing there
		Had worn them really about the same,

		And both that morning equally lay
		In leaves no step had trodden black.
		Oh, I kept the first for another day!
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
		I doubted if I should ever come back.

		I shall be telling this with a sigh
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - 
		I took the one less traveled by
		And that has made all the difference.

def fire_and_ice_body

	<<-HTML

		Some say the world will end in fire,
		Some say in ice.
		From what I've tasted of desire
		I hold with those who favor fire.
		But if I had to perish twice,
		I think I know enough of hate
		To say thay for destruction ice
		Is also great
		And would suffice.

def going_for_water_body

	<<-HTML

		The well was dry beside the door,
		And so we went with pail and can
		Across the fields behind the house
		To seek the brook if still it ran;

		Not loth to have excuse to go,
		Because the autumn eve was fair
		(Though chill), because the fields were ours,
		And by the brook our woods were there.

		We ran as if to meet the moon
		That slowly dawned behind the trees,
		The barren boughs without the leaves,
		Without the birds, without the breeze.

		But once within the wood, we paused
		Like gnomes that hid us from the moon,
		Ready to run to hiding new
		With laughter when she found us soon.

		Each laid on other a staying hand
		To listen ere we dared to look,
		And in the hush we joined to make
		We heard, we knew we heard the brook.

		A note as from a single place,
		A slender tinkling fail that made
		Now drops that floated on the pool
		Like pearls, and now a silver blade.
